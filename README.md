# Bitnami Express Development Container

## TL;DR;

### Local workspace

```bash
$ mkdir ~/myapp && cd ~/myapp
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-express/master/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up
```

### Eclipse Che workspace

Launch a on-demand Express development workspace in Eclipse Che by clicking the link below:

[![Express Development Workspace](http://beta.codenvy.com/factory/resources/codenvy-contribute.svg)](https://beta.codenvy.com/f/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Farecio%2Fbitnami-docker-express%2Ftree%2Funify)

You can find the configuration files used on the previous link in the [Che branch](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-express/tree/che). For more information about Eclipse Che workspaces check the [official documentation](https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/introduction).

## Introduction

[Express.js](http://expressjs.org/), or simply Express, is a web application framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), released as free and open-source software under the [MIT License](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/LICENSE).

The Bitnami Express Development Container has been carefully engineered to provide you and your team with a highly reproducible Express development environment. We hope you find the Bitnami Express Development Container useful in your quest for world domination. Happy hacking!

[Learn more about Bitnami Development Containers.](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/use-bitnami-development-containers/)

## Getting started

The quickest way to get started with the Bitnami Express Development Container is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Begin by creating a directory for your Express application:

```bash
mkdir ~/myapp
cd ~/myapp
```

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-express/master/docker-compose.yml) file in the application directory:

```bash
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-express/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Finally launch the Express application development environment using:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Among other things, the above command creates a container service, named `myapp`, for Express development and bootstraps a new Express application in the application directory. You can use your favorite IDE for developing the application.

> **Note**
>
> If the application directory contained the source code of an existing Express application, the Bitnami Express Development Container would load the existing application instead of bootstrapping a new one.

After the Node application server has been launched in the `myapp` service, visit http://localhost:3000 in your favorite web browser and you'll be greeted by the default Express welcome page.

In addition to the Express Development Container, the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-express/master/docker-compose.yml) file also configures a MongoDB service to serve as the NoSQL database backend of your Express application.

## Executing commands

Commands can be launched inside the `myapp` Express Development Container with `docker-compose` using the [exec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/) command.

> **Note**:
>
> The `exec` command was added to `docker-compose` in release [1.7.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170-2016-04-13). Please ensure that you're using `docker-compose` version `1.7.0` or higher.

The general structure of the `exec` command is:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec <service> <command>
```

, where `<service>` is the name of the container service as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file and `<command>` is the command you want to launch inside the service.

Following are a few examples of launching some commonly used Express development commands inside the `myapp` service container.

- Load the Node.js REPL:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose exec myapp node
  ```

- List installed NPM modules:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose exec myapp npm ls
  ```

- Install a NPM module:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose exec myapp npm install bootstrap --save
  $ docker-compose restart myapp
  ```

## Connecting to Database

Express by default does not require a database connection to work but we provide a running and configured MongoDB service and an example file `config/mongodb.js` with some insights for how to connect to it.

You can use [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) ODM in your application to model your application data.

## Going to Production

The Express Development Container generates a Dockerfile in your working directory. This can be used to create a production-ready container image consisting of your application code and its dependencies.

1. Build your Docker image

  ```bash
  $ docker build -t myregistry/myapp:1.0.0
  ```

2. Push to an image registry

  ```bash
  $ docker push myregistry/myapp:1.0.0
  ```

3. Update orchestration files to reference the pushed image

## Issues

If you encountered a problem running this container, you can file an [issue](../../issues/new). For us to provide better support, be sure to include the following information in your issue:

- Host OS and version (`uname -a`)
- Docker version (`docker version`)
- Docker info (`docker info`)
- Docker image version (`echo $BITNAMI_IMAGE_VERSION` inside the container)
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
